MEAN stack application for sharing among friends

## Helping Hand ##

## Private marketplace for friends to borrow household items ##

## Helping Hand allows a private sharing of household items for use among local friends and acquaintences.  Anything from cleaning (steam cleaner to tidy up before the inlaws arrive), cooking (all the equipment you need for that summer bbq), or living room (speaker set for this weekend's party) -- why not ask a friend? ##

## We're all generous toward our friends but it's always a little awkward to ask to borrow or tedious to call around to see if your buddy has what you need.  For the lender, it's also a bit strange to ask for your stuff back if your friend is keeping your stuff too long. For now, the best solution is a rogue facebook message or a mass text, why not a better way? ##

## Helping Hand allows a marketplace for a group of friends to post items they have around the house that they'd be willing to lend, as well as a list of items they need.  The system will match friends offering and requesting items around the same date ranges.  Once a transaction is finalized, a set amount of time is specified by the lender and notice is sent to both parties a day before the expiry date. ##
